review
The car was in good condition but the delivery was 2 hours late.
Excellent service and clean vehicle. Staff was very helpful!
Terrible experience. Car broke down on the highway.
Average service. Nothing exceptional.
Pickup was smooth but drop-off took too long.
The AC was not working properly and the staff didnâ€™t respond well.
Loved the car! Smooth ride and very clean.
Very unprofessional behavior from the staff.
Good service overall but the fuel tank was not full.
The return process was quick and efficient.
